1               # number of Mach (option 2), if = 0 the table is build with a Mach variation  delta_Mach
0.01            # delta_Mach, Mach step
2.00d0          # initial Mach  (for a single Mach calculus it is this value) 
1.02d0          # final Mach 
1001            # Number of points on the shock curve for a given Mach
1.d-2           # Accuracy to determine the wall deviation angle, for a given shock wave angle (in degrees) 
1               # 1 : Newton algorithm + RK4, 0 : Euler order 1 integration, 2 : old version of Newton
10001           # number of discrete points  - angle - between the shock line and the wall
1.d-5           # abs(u_theta) on the wall cone.
0               # velocity option =>  1: tangential velocity is saved in a file  
# if Mach number = 0 used of Delta Mach
