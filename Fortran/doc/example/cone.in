0.01            # delta_Mach, Mach number step
2.00d0          # Initial Mach number
1.02d0          # Final Mach number
1001            # Number of points on the plot for a given Mach number  
1.d-2           # Accuracy to determine the wall deviation angle, for a given shock wave angle (in degrees)  
1               # 1 : Newton's algorithm     0 : Order 1 integration  (less accurate)
10001           # number of discrete points  - angle - between the shock line and the wall
1.d-5           # abs(u_theta) on the cone wall
