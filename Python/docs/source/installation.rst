The next operations have to be done :

#. To verify if a fortran compiler is installed (if it will be used)
#. To verify if a python interpreter is installed.
#. To use Maple files the Software Maple has to be installed (it is not free). Some ascii files and pdf files are also given in the **FundAeroSuite**.
#. To use Matlab files, the Software Matlab has to be installed (it is not free). The Matlab script are in ascii files in the downloaded directories.
#. In each directory a README file help to understand the content and gives some indications for installation.



Python
******* 

The python sources are located in the *Python* directory.

Fortran

The fortran routines can be compiled with a *Makefile* in the  Fortran directory where 6 programms are available.

But it is possible to compile and run the Fortran codes with the Python tool (see later).
