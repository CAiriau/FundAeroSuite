# FunAeroSuite
## Solutions of Fundamental Aerodynamics Exercices and Problems

The text of the problems and exercices will be found into the book
**Exercices et Problèmes d'Aérodynamique Fondamentale**,
Christophe Airiau, André Giovannini, Pierre Brancher
Cépadues Editions, France
2019

The suite will contains python, fortran, matlab and Maple sources.

It will be soon available (March 2019)

### Content
The suite will follow the chapter book which is written in the French language :
1. Equations générales de conservation et d'évolution (*General equations of conservation and evolution*) 
2. Modèles mathématiques pour l'aérodynamique (*Mathematical models for aerodynamics*)  
3. Théorie des potentiels complexes : application aux profils d'aile (*Com*plex potential theory : application to airfoils*) 
4. Théorie linéarisée des profils minces  (*Linearized theory of thin airfoils*) 
5. Théorie de la ligne portante de Lanchester-Prandtl (*Lifting line Lanchester-Prandtl theory*)
6. Théorie de la surface portante et des corps élancés (*Lifting surface theory and slender bodies*) 
7. Aspects numériques : méthode des singularités (*panel method*)
8. Ecoulements compressible subsonique et transsonique (*Compressible subsonic and transonic flow*)
9. Ecoulements supersoniques linéarisés (*Linearized supersonic flows*)
10. Ecoulements compressibles monodimensionnels (*One-dimensional compressible flows*)
11. Ecoulements supersoniques bidimensionnels (*Two-dimensional supersonic flows*)
12. Méthodes des caractéristiques en régimes stationnaire et instationnaire (*Method of characteristics for steady and unsteady flows*)
13. Ecoulements supersoniques : corps élancés et ailes (*Slender bodies and wings in supersonic flows*)
14. Ecoulements hypersoniques (*Hypersonic flows*)
15. Effets visqueux et couche limite (*Viscous flows and boundary layer*)

#### Codes
* The book contains the corrections of 119 problems and exercices and the suite is composed of the corrections of approximately 100 of them.

* Approximately 80 problems or exercices solutions are given in **Python**
* Approximately 20 problems or exercices solutions are given in **Fortran**
* Some corrections are also given in Matlab 
* Some corrections are given in Maple (formal) language
* Any part of codes written in Matlab or Maple can also be found (in some way) in Fortran or Python.
* The codes is written in some educational way in order to be easily understood even if the reader is not a programmer.
* Some additional tools/codes/programs are given, as for instance to calculate :
   * NACA 4 airfoils geometry
   * Standard atmosphere quantities
   * *to complete*
 * Many comments are added inside the code, unfortunaly many are written in French. Some effort will be done to progressively translate them in English.

### Installation :
* The Fortran codes can be compiled on any system (Windows, MacOs, Linus) as soon as a Fortran Compiler is installed
* The Python codes can be easily run with a minimun of knowledges :
    * a GUI can be used (validated only on Linux and Windows systems)
    * a main script can be used, and just the number of the exercice and the chapter have to be indicated
    * Python 3 can be installed for instance with anaconda, some interfaces as spyder3 can be used as well
* To use Maple files the Software Maple has to be installed (it is not free). Some ascii files and pdf files are also given.
* To use Matlab files, the Software Matlab has to be installed (it is not free). The Matlab script are in ascii files.
* In each directory a README file help to understand the content and gives some indications for installation.

### Documentation
* The book of exercices and problems provide the text and notations and some results.
* Additional documentation generated with _Oxygen_ will be added for some parts of the codes/tools
