Introduction
============

This documentation is about two Matlab tools related to fundamental aerodynamics:
* a Compressible Aerodynamics Tools named CAT, solving basing problem in 1D compressible flow (expansion, shock, ...)
* a tool to test the panel method, based on J. Katz book and fortran routines translated into Matlab language.

These tools are included into the suite named **FundAeroSuite** and available on
`github <https://github.com/CAiriau/FundAeroSuite>`_.

More complex CAT versions in Python and Fortan are also available accompagned with their own documentation.

The panel method tools has been validated from Katz's fortran code and has been used to validate the panel method
problem found in the Python suite.

For these reasons, the documentation is very short.


No effort has been made to detail inputs and outputs of Matlab functions, assuming that reading
the function will be clear enough for any user.
