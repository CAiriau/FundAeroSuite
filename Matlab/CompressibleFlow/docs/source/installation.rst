Installation
===================

No installation is required, the code can be downloaded and  the uset just need to test the main script with its menu.

99% of the codes will also work with **octave**. Plot details can be different.

Many Matlab functions can be used independently and be integrated in another code for own uses. 
The only important thing is to not forget to initialize the global parameters, as for instance 
:math:`\gamma` for compressible flows.

It is advised to use the main directory as the run directory, and to avoid to work in the directory containing
the main source files.
